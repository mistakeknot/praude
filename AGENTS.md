# AGENTS.md

## Ground Rules
- Run the superpowers bootstrap first:
  - `~/.codex/superpowers/.codex/superpowers-codex bootstrap`
- Use relevant superpowers skills for every task (TDD, writing-plans, executing-plans).
- Do not use git worktrees for this repo unless explicitly requested.
- Follow TDD strictly: write the failing test, watch it fail, then implement.
- Keep changes small, testable, and committed frequently.
- Default to ASCII-only edits unless the file already uses Unicode.

## Repo Overview
Praude is a TUI-first PM/specs CLI that generates, validates, and governs PRDs.
It orchestrates external agents (Codex, Claude Code, opencode, droid) and stores
specs as YAML files in `.praude/specs/`.

## Key Paths and Data
- `.praude/specs/` one YAML per PRD (source of truth).
- `.praude/research/` market/competitive research outputs (timestamped).
- `.praude/briefs/` agent briefs (timestamped; always written).
- `.praude/config.toml` agent profiles (command + args).
- `internal/specs/` schema, ID generation, validation, load/save.
- `internal/brief/` brief composer.
- `internal/agents/` profile resolution + process launch.
- `internal/git/` auto-commit helper.
- `internal/tui/` TUI model/view (TUI-first UX).
- `internal/cli/commands/` CLI parity with the TUI.

## Commands
- `praude` launches the TUI.
- `praude init` initializes `.praude/`.
- `praude list` prints PRD summaries.
- `praude show <id>` prints a spec file.
- `praude run <brief> --agent=<profile>` spawns an agent with a brief.

## Agent Integration (Codex/Claude/opencode/droid)
- Profiles live under `[agents]` in `.praude/config.toml`.
- Defaults must be safe to run (empty args), with commented examples.
- `praude run` must always write a brief first; if agent not found, print the
  brief path and exit cleanly.
- Briefs are always timestamped and persisted for auditability.

## Spec Schema + Validation
- Use the full PRD schema (strategic_context, user_story, summary, requirements,
  acceptance_criteria, files_to_modify, metadata).
- Validation checks required fields and returns actionable errors.
- Spec IDs are incremental `PRD-###`, derived by scanning `.praude/specs/`.
- Accept both `.yaml` and `.yml`, but write `.yaml`.

## Drift Control (PM Authority)
- Specs are the source of truth; briefs are derived views.
- Drift detection compares the current spec hash to the working context.
- If drift detected, user chooses:
  - Accept drift: update spec and auto-commit.
  - Reject drift: generate corrective guidance and re-run agent.

## Git Auto-Commit Rules
- Spec writes auto-commit with messages:
  - `chore(praude): add PRD-###`
  - `chore(praude): update PRD-###`
- Research/brief artifacts are committed if they modify spec state.
- Always use `internal/git` helpers; do not shell out ad-hoc.

## CLI/TUI Parity Rules
- CLI must mirror TUI capabilities.
- TUI is primary; CLI is for scripting and automation.
- Any new TUI action should have a CLI equivalent unless explicitly deferred.

## Testing
- Use TDD for all behavior changes.
- Run targeted tests (`go test ./internal/<package> -v`) while iterating.
- Add package-level tests before wiring multi-package behavior.
- Prefer small unit tests over broad integration tests.
